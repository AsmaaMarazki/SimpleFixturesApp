# SimpleFixturesApp
Contains two screens Fixtures and favourites</br>
Fixtures grouped by day and ordered descending but today's fixtures are first item</br>

Used coroutines, navigation component and retrofit.</br>
Used MVVM with clean architecture and Domain Driven Design</br>

why? to be able to use same domain layer with any kotlin project in future (like KMM) also coroutines helped me because it's pure kotlin and better in performance </br>

Used Linked HashMap in presentation mapper as it's guarantee order</br>
Used Hilt to achieve Dependency injection</br>

Clone project using android studio on master branch.</br>
